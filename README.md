# Deployments

A scalable and cost-effective deployment solution for managing multiple projects on shared infrastructure using Terraform and GitHub Actions.

## Overview

This repository provides an automated deployment pipeline that enables multiple projects to be deployed to shared infrastructure resources, optimizing costs while maintaining isolation and security. The solution uses Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and GitHub Actions for automated deployments.

## How It Works

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Users create their own repositories containing their application code (frontend and/or backend)
   - No special configuration is required in the user's repository
   - The deployment process is handled entirely by this repository

2. **Deployment Process**:
   - Users provide their repository name and desired domain name
   - This repository handles all infrastructure provisioning and deployment
   - Applications are automatically deployed to shared infrastructure
   - Each project is isolated within the shared infrastructure
   - Repository contents are accessed directly via GitHub's API

## Key Features

- **Multi-tenant Infrastructure**: Multiple projects can be deployed to the same DigitalOcean droplet, reducing infrastructure costs
- **Idempotent Deployments**: Safe and reliable deployments that can be run multiple times without side effects
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure is managed through Terraform, ensuring consistency and version control
- **Automated Workflows**: GitHub Actions automate the deployment process based on repository events
- **Shared Resources**: Common infrastructure components (droplets, databases) are shared across projects when possible
- **Zero Configuration Required**: No special setup needed in the user's repository
- **Direct API Access**: Repository contents accessed via GitHub's API without cloning

## Deployment Process

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**:
   - Terraform manages the creation and configuration of DigitalOcean droplets
   - Infrastructure is created only if it doesn't already exist
   - New projects are deployed to existing infrastructure when possible

2. **Project Deployment**:
   - Triggered via GitHub Actions
   - Requires repository name and domain name as inputs
   - Accesses repository contents directly via GitHub's API
   - Builds and deploys the application
   - Configures necessary networking and security settings
   - Handles SSL certificate provisioning

3. **Database Management** (Future Enhancement):
   - Shared database instances for multiple projects
   - Automated database provisioning and configuration
   - Secure isolation between projects

## Usage

To deploy a new project:

1. Ensure your application repository is ready for deployment
2. Configure the deployment with:
   - Your repository name
   - Desired domain name
3. Trigger the deployment workflow

The deployment system will:
- Access your repository contents via GitHub's API
- Build your application
- Deploy it to the shared infrastructure
- Configure all necessary networking and security settings

## Infrastructure Components

- **DigitalOcean Droplets**: Shared compute resources
- **Networking**: Managed through Terraform
- **Security**: Automated firewall and security group configuration
- **Databases**: (Planned) Shared database instances with project isolation

## Cost Optimization

This solution is designed to minimize infrastructure costs by:
- Sharing compute resources across multiple projects
- Automatically scaling infrastructure based on demand
- Optimizing resource allocation
- Reducing the number of required infrastructure components

## Security

- Each project is isolated within the shared infrastructure
- Automated security configurations
- Regular security updates and patches
- SSL/TLS encryption for all deployments
- Secure API-based repository access

## Future Enhancements

- Shared database infrastructure
- Automated backup solutions
- Monitoring and logging integration
- Cost tracking and optimization
- Additional cloud provider support
